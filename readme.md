# These are my solutions to the course at  -  https://java-programming.mooc.fi/
    I haven't solved every exercise.
    I won't be commiting exercises I haven't solved, so their files will be missing.
    You can download the clean exercise files from the site.
    You can find all the exercises and learning material there too.
To see my solutions:
1. Go inside the corresponding "Half" folder
2. Find the file with the part you're looking for (parts 1 to 14)
3. Find the exercise number and name that comes after "Part" (example  -  part08-Part08_**01.Cubes**)
4. Go to src -> main -> java -> solutions will be here but proceed inside packages if necessary
